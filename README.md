🎉 **I’ve built my own version of my Linktree profile!**

Inspired by my current Linktree page — [linktr.ee/takeruwu](https://linktr.ee/takeruwu) — I decided to create a **custom, self-hosted version** of it using my own code and design. This new version reflects my personal style more accurately and gives me full control over how it looks and functions.

✨ Some key highlights of my version:

* Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
* Custom styling to match my aesthetic (dark theme, Gen Z/hip-hop-inspired vibe).
* Lightning-fast performance — no third-party bloat!
* Clean, minimal code built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind or custom), and optionally JS.
* Easily editable structure to add or update links whenever I want.

💡 Why I made this:
While Linktree is great, I wanted something more unique — something that truly represented *me*. Building it myself allowed me to learn, experiment, and add features that platforms like Linktree don’t offer without a paid plan.

🛠️ If you're curious or want to build your own, I’m happy to share the code or tips on how to do it!

Would you like to check it out? I can drop the link or share the codebase here. Just let me know. 😎

Let me know if you want a version for your **portfolio**, **GitHub**, or even **as a tweet or Instagram caption**.
